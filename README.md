# D-AIM_Hackathon2.0

The arrival of the internet and digital technology has profoundly changed the media, especially the written press. At a time when more information has never been produced and consumed, the press has long struggled to find its new place in this digitized environment. The recent success of certain newspapers such as Le Desk, Le 360 or Telquel proves that a future is possible via a digital plan that guarantees the customer's immersion in the written content.

The newsletter is a major component of interaction with readers. It is a digest of information coming from a website and sent by email to a group of individuals who have voluntarily subscribed to it. The newsletter can be generic news or personalized according to content recommendations.

D-News is one of the major players in the digital press with various articles offering limited free content, subscription formulas, Ã  la carte reading and access to a weekly newsletter on personalized sections according to the interests of readers.
In order to guarantee the recruitment of new readers and to ensure continuous contact with old readers, D-News offered its Data Science team navigation data on the website. This data is based on cookies collected over a period of 30 days of navigation from several readers identified by a unique ID as well as the list of readers who have decided to opt-in to the newsletter.

The expected objective is to analyze the browsing paths and navigation patterns to describe the situation of the readers subscribed to the newsletter and to lead to an approach based on the Machine Learning in order to increase the number of subscribers to the newsletter and to propose improvements and adaptations of the browsing path on the website.
